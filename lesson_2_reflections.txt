What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

To initialize a git repository, I use git init. It will create a .git folder that is not visible in windows explorer
but that I can see in gitbash using command ls ~a. I need to inititalize a git repository if I want to start tracking
changes made to the files in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary stage. It's not showing as a saved commit yet and it's not the version from the working directory.
It gives room to avoid errors in saving and it helps keep commit well thought out and keep a clean repository.
