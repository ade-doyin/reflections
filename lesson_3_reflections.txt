When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is better when working with a team or if I'm going to be working from
different computers..

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to be in control of what will show in my GitHub repository. I may not want my remote
repository to be updated with every commits. I may prefer to wait until a specific stage is reached.
